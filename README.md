# Linguistic-Learners-Automatic-Lip-Reading
This project contains an Automated Lip Reading (ALR) model using Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks. Two models have been trained for our application using the Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) dataset.

This project was based off mpc001's repository Lipreading_using_Temporal_Convolutional_Networks - https://github.com/mpc001/Lipreading_using_Temporal_Convolutional_Networks

To use this application you will need to download the models from this Google Drive directory - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ul-bhYOithL3cFqUdpEaYSm4bTBeLCfG?usp=sharing
The model directory contains two models which our group trained (10 word model and 20 word model) and another model which has been trained on the full 500 words by other data scientists.

This application uses Django for the front-end to make the models that have been used accessable in a web application.
